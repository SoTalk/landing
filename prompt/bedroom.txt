Bedroom

Create a hyper-realistic renovation timelapse video that transforms the exact abandoned bedroom shown in the reference image into a refined, elegant, luxury residential bedroom, strictly following real-world architectural, construction, interior-design, and acoustic logic.



This must look like a real on-site renovation documented by a professional construction firm, not an AI concept, cinematic montage, or stylized visualization.



No fantasy design

No impossible layouts

No stylization

No AI artifacts



The final space must feel quietly luxurious, high-end, and fully livable, completed with professional craftsmanship.



📷 CAMERA — ABSOLUTE LOCK (NON-NEGOTIABLE)



Fixed static camera from first frame to last



No pan, tilt, zoom, shake, drift, or reframing



Same lens throughout (24–28mm wide angle)



Same framing, same perspective, same scale



Entire bedroom visible at all times



No cuts, no transitions, no camera jumps



Camera behaves like a mounted tripod / CCTV



🏚️ INITIAL STATE — MUST MATCH REFERENCE IMAGE EXACTLY



Small abandoned bedroom (approx. 2 × 3 meters)



Severely cracked walls with peeling paint and stains



Ceiling badly damaged or partially collapsed



Floor uneven, dirty, covered with debris and fallen plaster



Old rusted bed frame with ruined mattress



Broken bedside table or minimal damaged furniture



Cold natural daylight only



Extremely neglected, unsafe, and claustrophobic condition



⚠️ DO NOT CHANGE (STRICT)



Room proportions



Window position



Ceiling height



Floor footprint



Renovation only — no redesign of room size or layout.



👷‍♀️ WORKERS — REALISTIC & PROFESSIONAL



Small professional construction crew



Men and women allowed, natural and respectful



Functional construction clothing only



Work shirts or coveralls



Work pants or jeans



Safety boots, gloves



Helmets and safety vests in realistic random colors



Behavior rules



No posing



No flirting



No slow motion



No body emphasis



Movements are efficient, purposeful, professional



⏱️ TIMELAPSE — REAL CONSTRUCTION ORDER

No cinematic or dramatic music



No audio when workers are not visible
