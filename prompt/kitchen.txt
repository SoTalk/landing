Kitchen



Create a hyper-realistic renovation timelapse video that transforms the exact abandoned interior shown in the reference image into a modern, elegant, fully livable interior space, strictly following real-world architectural, construction, and interior-design logic.

This must look like a real renovation documented on-site, not an AI concept, cinematic montage, or stylized visualization.

No fantasy design
No impossible layouts
No stylization
No AI artifacts

The final result must feel safe, functional, realistic, and professionally finished, as if completed by a real architecture & construction firm.

📷 CAMERA — ABSOLUTE LOCK (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

Fixed static camera from first frame to last

No pan, tilt, zoom, shake, drift, or reframing

Same lens throughout (24–28mm wide angle)

Same framing, same perspective, same scale

Entire room visible at all times

No cuts, no transitions, no camera jumps

Camera behaves like a mounted tripod / CCTV

🏚️ INITIAL STATE — MUST MATCH REFERENCE IMAGE EXACTLY

Abandoned interior space with internal staircase on the right

Severely peeling and cracked wall paint

Exposed brick sections on walls

Damaged plaster and partially broken ceiling

Dirty concrete floor covered with debris and fallen plaster

Old, broken kitchen counter and sink on the left side

Rusted stair railing and worn concrete steps

Single window at the back providing cold natural daylight

Extremely neglected, unsafe, abandoned condition

⚠️ NO hallucinated elements

No bedroom furniture

No extra rooms

No added windows or doors

⚠️ DO NOT CHANGE (CRITICAL)

Room proportions

Stair position, angle, and size

Window position and size

Ceiling height

Floor footprint

Renovation only — no redesign of structure or layout

👷 WORKERS — REALISTIC & PROFESSIONAL

Small professional construction crew

Men and women allowed, portrayed naturally and respectfully

Appearance

Functional construction clothing only

Work shirts or coveralls

Work pants or jeans

Safety boots, gloves

Helmets and high-visibility vests in realistic random colors

Behavior

No posing

No flirting

No slow motion

No body emphasis

Efficient, purposeful, professional movements

⏱️ TIMELAPSE — REAL CONSTRUCTION ORDER

Photorealistic timelapse at 30fps, condensed to 12–20 seconds, following real renovation workflow:

1️⃣ Cleaning & Clearing

Water spray, sweeping, debris removal

Old kitchen units dismantled and removed

Loose plaster cleared from floor and stairs

2️⃣ Structural Repair

Cracked plaster removed

Walls repaired and leveled

Exposed brick stabilized

Ceiling fully repaired and sealed

3️⃣ Staircase Restoration

Steps repaired and cleaned

Railing restored or replaced with modern but realistic design

No change in stair position or geometry

4️⃣ Surface Renovation

Walls repainted (neutral modern tones)

Ceiling finished clean and smooth

Floor replaced with realistic modern material (tile or polished concrete)

5️⃣ Lighting & Utilities

Ceiling lighting installed

Wall lighting added if realistic

Warm, natural interior lighting

6️⃣ Final Interior Setup

Minimal modern furniture appropriate to the space

Clean, functional, livable interior

No clutter, no over-decoration

🔊 AUDIO — REALISTIC & SYNCED (CRITICAL)

Audio perfectly synchronized with visible actions

Real construction sound logic

Naturally time-compressed

Audio progression

Cleaning: water spray, sweeping, debris movement

Repair: scraping, hammering, drilling

Painting: rollers, sanding

Installation: tool sounds, soft placement

Final: subtle ambient room tone

❌ No cinematic music
❌ No audio when workers are not visible
❌ No desync or volume jumps

🧠 DESIGN RULES — INTERIOR SPACE

Modern minimalist interior

Neutral colors: white, beige, soft gray, wood accents

Real materials only

Functional, realistic living space

❌ No floating furniture
❌ No warped walls or floors
❌ No unrealistic lighting

🏁 FINAL RESULT

Fully renovated modern interior

Staircase preserved and integrated naturally

Looks like a real renovation timelapse

Professional, elegant, realistic

Never looks AI-generated

❌ NEGATIVE PROMPT (HARD BLOCK)

no camera movement
no scene jump
no instant transformation
no fantasy architecture
no warped objects
no floating furniture
no distorted proportions
no cinematic over-stylization
no AI artifacts
no unsynced or fake audio
