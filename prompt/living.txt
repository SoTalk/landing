LIVING ROOM

Objective: Document real construction footage transforming abandoned living room into modern relaxation space. Must look like actual jobsite documentation, NOT AI/CGI.

🎥 CAMERA (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

Fixed tripod position, 24mm wide angle
NO pan, tilt, zoom, cuts, or reframing
Entire room visible throughout
Only natural slight shake during heavy work
Think: Construction site CCTV footage
🏚️ STARTING CONDITION

Single living room/ruang santai (approx. 4×5m):

Old fabric sofa along left wall (worn, stained)
Wooden plank floor: worn, dirty, partially broken
Walls: peeling patterned wallpaper, water stains
Ceiling: damaged wooden panels, cracks, holes, water damage
Multiple windows (right/back walls): dirty, some broken glass
Overgrown plants/grass entering through windows
Debris, broken plaster, wood scattered on floor
Cold natural daylight, neglected appearance
FORBIDDEN ELEMENTS:

No bedroom furniture (bed, wardrobe)
No extra rooms, stairs, or added doors/windows
DO NOT CHANGE: Room size, window count/positions, ceiling height, floor layout, camera angle

👷 WORKERS (NATURAL & PROFESSIONAL)

3-5 construction crew, mixed gender, age 25-55
Standard work clothes: coveralls, work pants, safety gear (helmets, vests, boots)
Clothing shows realistic dirt accumulation
Natural purposeful movements, NO posing or camera awareness
Workers enter/exit naturally as tasks require
⏱️ RENOVATION SEQUENCE (12-20 sec, 30fps)

PHASE 1: Clearing (0-3s)

Remove overgrown plants from windows/floor
Workers carry old sofa out through doorway
Sweep debris into bags/buckets
Remove loose ceiling panels and wallpaper strips
Room becomes progressively empty
Audio: Plant rustling, furniture dragging, sweeping, debris falling
PHASE 2: Demolition & Repair (3-7s)

Strip remaining wallpaper (show peeling action)
Remove damaged ceiling panels section by section
Patch wall holes with compound (apply → dry → sand)
Repair ceiling structure with new panels
Show wet compound → matte drying progression
Audio: Ripping wallpaper, light hammering, troweling, sanding
PHASE 3: Surface Finishing (7-12s)

Ceiling: primer → first coat → final coat (white)
Walls: primer → first coat → final coat (warm beige/soft gray)
Floor: sand wooden planks OR install new laminate row by row
Paint transitions from wet sheen → matte finish
Each surface completed before moving to next
Audio: Rolling paint, brush strokes, floor sanding/installation
PHASE 4: Windows & Lighting (12-14s)

Clean windows inside and out (visible wiping motion)
Replace broken glass panes
Install ceiling light fixtures (worker on ladder)
Install wall sconces or floor lamp outlets
Lights turn on gradually, warm glow fills room
Natural daylight becomes clear and balanced
Audio: Window cleaning squeaks, glass handling, drilling, light clicks
PHASE 5: Furnishing (14-18s)

Modern sofa carried in through doorway, positioned along wall
Coffee table placed in center
Area rug unrolled and positioned under furniture
Side table/accent chair added
Each piece grounded firmly, realistic weight
NO instant appearance or floating
Audio: Furniture scraping/placement, fabric sounds, soft thuds
PHASE 6: Completion (18-20s)

Add throw pillows and blankets to sofa
Place small potted plants (on table/windowsill)
Add books, minimal decor items
Final dusting/cleaning
Workers exit with tools
Empty peaceful living room
Audio: Soft placement sounds fading to ambient room tone
🎨 FINAL DESIGN

Colors: Warm white/beige walls (#F5F5F0), white ceiling, light wood/neutral floor, soft gray/beige sofa Lighting:Natural daylight through clean windows + warm LED ceiling/wall lights (2700K) Furniture: Modern minimalist sofa, low coffee table, area rug, optional side table/chair Layout: Sofa against wall, coffee table centered, 60-80cm clearances Mood: Clean, bright, comfortable, professionally finished

🔊 AUDIO SYNC (CRITICAL)

Every visible action has matching sound
Volume matches work intensity
Time-compressed naturally with pitch adjustment
Sounds fade with workers entering/exiting
Medium room reverb (larger than bedroom)
NO music or dramatic effects
❌ PREVENT AI ARTIFACTS

Morphing/Warping:

No walls bending or liquifying
No furniture growing from floor
No window frames distorting
No geometry changes
Temporal Issues:

No instant color changes
No teleporting workers/objects
No sofa appearing from nowhere (must be carried in)
Show ALL intermediate steps (wallpaper peeling, paint drying)
Physical Impossibilities:

No floating furniture
No defying gravity
No wrong-scale items
No plants growing/shrinking unrealistically
Sofa must look heavy and grounded
Lighting Errors:

No shadows disappearing/reappearing
No sudden brightness jumps
No window light direction changing
Natural daylight progresses realistically
Texture Problems:

No CGI-perfect surfaces
No unrealistic wood grain flow
No textures that slide/swim
No fabric that looks plastic
Materials must look physically accurate
✅ REALISM CHECKLIST

[ ] Camera never moves
[ ] Old sofa carried out piece by piece
[ ] Wallpaper strips peel gradually
[ ] Paint dries gradually (wet sheen → matte)
[ ] New furniture carried in through doorway
[ ] Plants removed naturally, not vanishing
[ ] Windows cleaned with visible wiping motion
[ ] Workers look natural, task-focused
[ ] All objects have weight/physics
[ ] Lighting changes smooth and logical
[ ] Sounds perfectly synced to actions
[ ] Room proportions constant
[ ] Window count/positions unchanged
[ ] Could pass as real contractor documentation
🎯 GENERATION APPROACH

Style: Documentary construction footage Priority: Physical realism > aesthetic perfection Key principle: Show the PROCESS, not just before/after Focus: Old sofa removal and new sofa installation must look completely natural

Critical moments to get right:

Sofa being carried out (show lifting, carrying, doorway passage)
Wallpaper peeling (strips coming off in sheets)
Paint application (roller marks visible, wet to dry)
New sofa being carried in (reverse of removal, realistic weight)
Windows going from dirty to clean (gradual wiping)
When in doubt: choose mundane/realistic over stylized/dramatic
