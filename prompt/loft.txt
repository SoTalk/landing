Transform the exact abandoned multi-level loft into a modern, fully livable residential space, following real-world construction, architectural, and interior-design logic.

This must look like real on-site renovation documentation, not AI art, not cinematic, not stylized.

No fantasy
No impossible transformations
No AI artifacts

The final result must feel safe, functional, code-compliant, and completed by a professional architecture & construction firm.

📷 CAMERA — ABSOLUTE LOCK (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

Fixed static camera, rigid mount (CCTV / tripod-like)

Zero movement: no pan, tilt, zoom, shake, drift

Same framing, same perspective, same scale throughout

Wide-angle lens: 24–28mm

Entire room visible at all times

No cuts, no transitions, no reframing

Continuous single shot from start to finish

🏗️ SPATIAL LAYOUT — LOCKED & LOGICAL

LOWER LEVEL: Kitchen + Living / Dining

UPPER LEVEL: Bedroom + optional small workspace

STAIRCASE: Permanent, safe connection between levels

Spatial Rules (Cannot Change)

Wall positions never move

Window size and position stay identical

Ceiling heights remain constant

Floor area does not expand or shrink

Mezzanine structure remains fixed

Straight lines stay straight (no warping)

🎯 CONSISTENCY RULES (CRITICAL)

Objects

No random appearing/disappearing

Removed items never return

Installed items stay permanently

No teleporting furniture

No color or material flickering

Physics

Gravity always active

No floating objects

Heavy items require 2–3 workers

Dust falls downward

Water flows realistically

Wet paint dries gradually

Workers

Same faces throughout entire video

Same outfit colors and PPE

3–6 workers maximum, consistent count

Enter and exit only through doors

No sudden outfit or body changes

Correct human proportions

Lighting

Natural daylight shifts gradually (morning → afternoon → evening)

Shadows match sun direction

Artificial lights only appear after installation

Once installed, lights stay fixed

No lighting jumps or flicker

💡 LIGHTING DESIGN — MODERN & FUTURISTIC (REALISTIC)

All exposed pipes, conduits, and wiring are fully removed or concealed

Clean ceiling finish with integrated modern lighting systems:

Recessed linear LED strips

Slim ceiling profiles

Indirect cove lighting

Neutral white light (3000K–4000K)

No visible bulbs, no hanging industrial lamps

No decorative neon, no sci-fi glow

Lighting looks architectural, subtle, and real

🧱 MATERIAL BEHAVIOR (REALISM LOCK)

Paint: wet/glossy → dries matte

Wood grain consistent direction

Metal finish never morphs

Tile patterns remain aligned

No texture stretching or melting

All materials have realistic weight and thickness

📐 SCALE & DIMENSIONS (REAL-WORLD)

Doors: 2.0–2.1m height

Stairs:

Risers: 17–19cm

Treads: 25–30cm

Angle: 30–35°

Kitchen counter height: 90–95cm

Walkways: minimum 90cm

Stair headroom: minimum 2m

Furniture fits through doors physically

⏱️ TIMELAPSE SEQUENCE (15–20 SECONDS TOTAL)

1️⃣ Demolition (3–4s)

Workers enter

Pressure washing (visible water spray)

Remove old furniture out of frame

Sweep debris, bag waste

Space becomes empty

2️⃣ Structural Prep (2–3s)

Remove damaged plaster

Secure and conceal wiring

No exposed pipes remain

Apply primer and patch walls

3️⃣ Surfaces (3–4s)

Walls: plaster → primer → base coat → final coat

Floors: remove old → subfloor → new finish laid row by row

Ladders reposition logically

4️⃣ Staircase (2–3s)

Remove old ladder

Install structure bottom-up

Treads → railing posts → handrail

Workers climb partially built stairs during install

5️⃣ Kitchen (LOWER LEVEL) (2–3s)

Mark layout

Install base cabinets

Plumbing concealed

Countertop lifted by 2–3 workers

Upper cabinets → appliances → backsplash → sink & faucet

6️⃣ Furniture (2–3s)

Lower: sofa (2 workers), table, chairs

Upper: bed frame carried upstairs, mattress separate

All movement realistic and continuous

7️⃣ Final Touch (1–2s)

Install modern lights using ladder

Hang art, place plants, cushions

Final cleaning

Lights turn on

Workers exit

🎨 DESIGN — PICK ONE STYLE ONLY

Choose ONE and stay consistent:

Scandinavian / Warm Contemporary / Japandi / Nordic Luxury / Mediterranean

Then lock:

ONE wall color

ONE wood type

ONE metal finish

ONE floor material

ONE countertop material

ONE cabinet style

No style mixing. No changes mid-video.

❌ FORBIDDEN (STRICT)

Any camera movement or cuts

Changing room dimensions

Exposed pipes after renovation

Kitchen upstairs or bedroom downstairs

Painting before plastering

Appliances before cabinets

One worker lifting heavy items

Neon colors or CGI gloss

Morphing textures

Duplicate or distorted workers

Workers posing or looking at camera

🏆 REALITY CHECK (MANDATORY)

Ask at every frame:

Can this happen in real life?

Would a contractor believe this?

Is the workflow correct?

Is lighting logical?

Any AI giveaway?

If any answer is NO → regenerate.

🔑 GENERATION KEYWORDS (IMPORTANT)

Use:

documentary construction photography, real renovation timelapse, photorealistic architectural documentation, authentic construction workflow, perfect spatial consistency, natural physics, zero AI artifacts

Avoid:

cinematic, artistic, magical, fantasy, stunning, unreal

Mindset:
Boring construction documentation → beautiful, believable result.
