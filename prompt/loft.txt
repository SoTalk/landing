LOFT RENOVATION TIMELAPSE PROMPT

Transform the exact abandoned multi-level loft into a modern, fully livable residential space, following real-world construction, architectural, and interior-design logic.

This must look like real on-site renovation documentation, not AI art, not cinematic, not stylized.

No fantasy | No impossible transformations | No AI artifacts

The final result must feel safe, functional, code-compliant, and completed by a professional architecture & construction firm.

Any AI giveaway?
Do materials match the selected style consistently?
If any answer is NO → regenerate.
