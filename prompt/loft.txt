Loft

STYLE

Modern Luxury (Contemporary, clean, architectural)

Minimalist but high-end

Precise geometry, sharp edges

Bold, refined, designer-grade residential feeling

Elegant contrast, calm but more dramatic

No decorative clutter, no rustic or industrial elements

🎨 COLOR SYSTEM (LOCKED)

Wall color: Soft warm gray (micro-cement look, smooth matte finish)

Ceiling color: Off-white / warm white (flat, seamless)

Floor color: Light gray marble (clean stone tone, subtle linear veining)

No color shifts during renovation.
No accent colors outside this palette.

🧱 MATERIAL SYSTEM — STRICT (NO WOOD ALLOWED)

🚫 Wood is completely forbidden
(no floors, no stairs, no furniture frames, no accents, no panels)

Approved materials only:

Floor material: Honed marble (stone texture, low-reflection, premium residential finish)

Stair structure: Dark titanium steel (slightly warmer than pure black)

Stair treads: Solid metal (brushed finish, anti-slip detailing)

Railing: Metal (dark titanium, ultra-slim profile, safety compliant)

Kitchen countertop: Dark quartz (charcoal tone, clean edges)

Cabinet finish: High-gloss glass (dark gray or graphite, handle-less)

Global metal finish: Dark titanium (consistent everywhere, no chrome, no silver)

No material switching mid-video.
Once installed, materials stay identical until final frame.

💡 LIGHTING SYSTEM (LOCKED)

Lighting temperature: 3000–3500K (warm luxury hotel tone)

Lighting type:

Indirect recessed lighting

Hidden linear LED channels (ceiling slots, stair undersides, kitchen toe-kicks)

No exposed bulbs

No hanging lamps

No visible fixtures

Lighting must feel:

Warm

Layered

Controlled contrast

Realistic for a finished high-end modern residence

⚠️ CONSISTENCY RULE (CRITICAL)

No design jumps

No style blending

No late-stage material changes

Final result must look intentionally designed from day one, not improvised


⚠️ WOOD IS COMPLETELY FORBIDDEN — ZERO EXCEPTIONS

🎯 OBJECTIVE (LOCKED)

Transform the exact abandoned multi-level loft into a luxury modern, fully livable residential space, strictly following real-world architectural, construction, structural, and interior-design logic.

This must look like real on-site renovation documentation, not AI art, not cinematic, not stylized.

No fantasy
No impossible transformations
No AI artifacts

Final result feels calm, expensive, code-compliant, and professionally built.

📷 CAMERA — ABSOLUTE LOCK (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

Fixed static camera (CCTV / rigid tripod)

LOWER LEVEL

Kitchen

Living / Dining area

UPPER LEVEL (MEZZANINE)

Bedroom

Optional compact workspace

STAIRCASE

Permanent modern stair connecting levels safely

Spatial Rules (Cannot Change)

Wall positions never move

Window size and position stay identical

Ceiling heights remain constant

Floor area does not expand or shrink

Mezzanine structure remains fixed

🔴 FULL SURFACE REPLACEMENT — ABSOLUTE LOCK

Walls

ALL walls fully stripped, repaired, primed, and repainted

If any original surface remains visible → INVALID RESULT

🎯 CONSISTENCY RULES (CRITICAL)

Objects

Removed items never return

Installed items stay permanently

No teleporting furniture

Physics

Gravity always active

No floating objects

Heavy items require 2–3 workers

Dust falls downward

Water flows realistically

Wet paint dries gradually

Workers

3–6 professional workers only

Same faces throughout

Same PPE and outfit colors

Enter/exit only through doors

No posing or camera awareness

Lighting Behavior

Natural daylight shifts gradually

Shadows follow sun direction

Artificial lights appear only after installation

Once installed, lights stay fixed

No flicker or jumps

💡 LIGHTING DESIGN — MODERN & LUXURY (REALISTIC)

All exposed pipes, conduits, and wiring fully removed or concealed

Clean flat ceilings

Recessed linear LED strips

Indirect cove lighting

Minimal architectural downlights

Neutral white light (per config)

No hanging lamps

No visible bulbs

No neon or sci-fi glow

📐 REAL-WORLD SCALE & DIMENSIONS

Kitchen counter height: 90–95cm

Walkways: ≥ 90cm

⏱️ RENOVATION TIMELAPSE SEQUENCE (15–20s)

1️⃣ Demolition
2️⃣ Structural prep
3️⃣ Walls, floor, ceiling installation
4️⃣ Stair installation
5️⃣ Kitchen installation
6️⃣ Furniture placement
7️⃣ Final lighting, cleaning, handover

Workflow order must be correct.

❌ STRICTLY FORBIDDEN

Any camera movement or cuts

Any wood material

🏆 REALITY CHECK (MANDATORY)

At every frame ask:

Could this happen in real life?

Would a contractor approve this?

Is the workflow correct?

Is lighting logical?

Any AI giveaway?

If any answer = NO → regenerate.

🔑 GENERATION KEYWORDS

Use:
documentary construction photography, real renovation timelapse, photorealistic architectural documentation, luxury modern interior, perfect spatial consistency, natural physics, zero AI artifacts

Avoid:
cinematic, artistic, fantasy, unreal, dramatic

🧠 MINDSET

Strict construction documentation → believable luxury result.
